"It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up."
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.
There are so many better places to visit!
This place is a must visit!
but the service was a bit slow.
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
Leave room for dessert.
I've been many time and have never been disappointed.
"Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good."
I'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing!
There is no excuse for such lousy service!
Sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun.
This is the case at this gem.
I'm saving up for my next visit.
Can't wait to go back.
We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York.
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.
Not sure if I would go back.
I'd go back there in a heartbeat.
"Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again."
"On that scale, it's a world-beater."
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
Keep up the good work guys!
Loved it!
The pizza’s are not huge and the crust is thin…keep that in mind when you’re ordering.
"However, this place is a gem, and I won't stop going back."
Priced at upper intermediate range.
I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far.
Very disappointed.
What more could you want?
This place is always very crowded and popular.
"Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people."
"I am so coming back here again, as much as I can."
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.
I will not go back.
But Im sure this was just an honest mistake...
"Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment."
"You'll be ther for every anniversary, birthday, valentines day..."
wont come back again for sure!
I've been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date.
We will be back.
"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care."
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
"Oh, and there's hookah."
Best Taiwanese food in NY!
Love YUKA.
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!
I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)
I do not think dinner in Manhattan should cost $400.00 where I am not swept off my feet.
"The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too."
I will definetly be going back.
Need I say more?
Stay away
Very pleased
"Overall, excellent restaurant!"
I just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - can't wait to celebrate my next birthday there.
"Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious."
Will not be back.
"Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY."
Believe it baby!
Worth the trip from Manhattan.
Amazing!
"The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol"
"Great food, spectacular location, and friendly service keep us coming back year after year."
"That place was awesome,,,  sally !"
Highly recommended.
We're going back. :D
I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself.
"I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was."
the food is always fresh ...
"All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted."
Very good wine choices.
"The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing."
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.
And they packaged everything nicely so it didn't spill.
Give it a try and enjoy.
Highly recommended!
"Oh, and the cheese fries are awesome!"
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
"The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often."
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
"Ruth, mother of the Bride"
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.
I highly recommend this beautiful place.
Dessert is a joke...dont bother
"In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots."
"The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place."
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.
Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.
"Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!"
To the owners of Open Sesame...Bravo...I can't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant!
"For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!"
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.
the turkey burgers are scary!
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
Zero ambiance to boot.
We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
"Drinks are suberb, and I feel like I am in a Third World country when I walk in the door."
It's to die for!
The appetizers are also delicious!
The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint.
"Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response."
And the service was simply spendid - quite a delight.
But too far east!
Love it.
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
"its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are."
"Well, I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management  to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips."
"Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait."
Be sure to try the oyster roll.
Hats off to the chef.
"Ambience is delightful, service impeccable."
No thanks!!!
Good for dates or with friends.
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY NICE PEOPLE AMAZING FOOD WOW
I'm partial to the Gnocchi.
"I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner."
It's just the right size for the menu.
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.
"If your looking for real quality  (not the BS that is seen on yelp ratings - which allegedly recently got in trouble for ""adjusting"" ratings), you need to get in here!"
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
Would NEVER go back
"Can get busy on Fridays for a table but once seated, the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly."
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.
Fantastic!
"Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special."
"If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona."
"If you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place..."
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
A guaranteeed delight!
10
You are bound to have a very charming time.
VERY GOOD!
"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service."
Will never be back.
Good eats.
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner.
"also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!"
Thank you
"if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!"
GO TO OPEN SESAME!!!
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
I can't wait to go back.
"This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset."
Wonderful at holiday time.
You can't go wrong with this place.
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.
Definately check it out!!!
"Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500."
"The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best."
"Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience."
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
"But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food"
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
We had a good time.
Ahhh...
"Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready."
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake.
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
really depends on your luck!
absolutely fabulous!!!
It isn't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time.
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.
"Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night."
A must try!
"Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart."
It was wonderful.
"The Dancing, White River and Millenium rolls are musts."
Always a winner.
"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy."
The food now is inconsistent.
It is not worth going at all and spend your money there!!!
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
My fav was the sassy lassi...
You are likely to be disappointed.
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
Probably would not go again...
But that is highly forgivable.
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
"The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for."
"Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house..."
"Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too."
"My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish."
"A big disappointment, all around."
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.
It was one of the few places in SoCal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car.
I'll be back for sure.
Doesn't get any better than that.
We will go back every time we are in the City.
"Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street, of course."
"I guarantee you won't be disappointed, there's also valet parking."
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.
I would highly recommend this place!
Great find in the West Village!
The only thing that strikes you is the decor?(not very pleasant).
"It's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center, not the greatest location, but the food keeps me coming back for more."
"We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York."
You can't go wrong here.
An excellent service
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat.
I appreciate their delivery too.
It just wasn't Thai.
"Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad."
"If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!"
"I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff."
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
"The best place for a leisure Sunday breakfast amidst yachts, then take a stroll through the nearby Farmer's Market."
Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead.
(2) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal.
It's a great place to enjoy food and meet friends.
"All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future."
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
There are no negatives to speak of.
It was pretty inexpensive too.
It's all about the food !!
"Should check-up on us more frequently, don't you think?"
"There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more)."
Perfection.
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
"Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it."
I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
I have been going back again and again.
Too many other good places to have to settle.
Good luck getting a table.
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
"Our teenage kids love it, too."
Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
"Delicious, creative and fun."
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.
I'd hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like.
Great neighborhood joint.
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
Not a great place for family or general dining.
We will definitely go back.
We'd go back again
All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!
I would go back.
Definitely has one of the best jukebox's i've seen in a long long time.
Eat at your own risk.
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
I cannot wait to go back again this coming weekend!
Southglenn is largest location.
Maybe tomorrow ;-)
Nice view of river and NYC.
"It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar..."
Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty.
"If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place."
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
Don't leave the restaurant without it.
Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place.
It's popular w/the late crowd.
I just don't understand all the hype...
Never had one single problem there.
less wait time for me!
The service was courteous and attentive.
not only is the food
Highly recommend it!
"I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service."
"Check out the art on the walls, very colorful!"
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.
"Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word."
Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
Highly recommended!
"Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!"
Beautiful experience.
No plans to return anytime soon.
Still we keep going back :)
I will NEVER return.
Go hungry and enjoy.
We all felt it was worth it.
The food was good too.
Run don't walk.
The wine list is excellent.
"it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose."
Avoid this place!
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.
I wish I COULD be refunded!
I will be back!
"With so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal, this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit."
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
"Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down."
Arigato Gozimas Yuka!
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
please don't fool us.
The service is really attentive and charming.
I'm going back.
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
Great sake!
LOL
If you're in the area you shouldn't be disappointed.
Service is average.
I/we will never go back to this place again.
"For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan."
"How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me."
It's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.
"A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each."
Probably would not go back here.
I look forward to eating here again
DONOT GO!
It's a small cute restaurant.
The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location.
Highly recommended to all!
You can order to go if you have to get back to the office too!
I loved it and would go again.
"However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!"
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.

"To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora."
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Nice job!
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!
The wine list is also really nice.
We will be back.
The food is great and they make a mean bloody mary.
The nicest waiters in town.
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.
Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.
I will never return again.
Me and my girls will definitely go back.
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
"The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great."
I definitely wouldn't go back.
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
"BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce."
A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year.
I don't know if I'll be back....
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.
NO PIZZA 33 for me!
Ciao Bella
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
"Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops."
"However, they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone."
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
"The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date."
"Snooze provided an inventive pancake offering, but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality."
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation (if possible)
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
The regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive.
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
I'd definitely go back again.
"Will comeback for sure, wish they have it here in LA.."
"Just straight up cheap, good food."
It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!
"But nonetheless--great spot, great food."
Big thumbs up!
It's a great place to order from or sit-in.
"they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece."
"Oh yeah...the view was good, too."
Can't wait wait for my next visit.
"Next time we will go somewhere else, or try other restaurants close by like Mimi's Cafe and Claim Jumper."
There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink..... this place is not worth it...
"In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town."
i would just ask for no oil next time.
it's delicious!
What a find!
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.
so delicious!!!!!!
You will not be disapointed at all.
Will give it another chance before I write it off.
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
and all you other people that have a problem get some help
What more can you ask for?
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.
Great food.
Great survice
I am going to the mid town location next.
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
They are not greasy or anything.
It hits the spot every time
good sake selection.
"The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town."
"Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor."
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
skip dessert.
highly recommended.
I noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place!
How do you rate home?
"When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices."
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
Can't wait to go back.
Never again!
The place is the next best thing to my Moms cooking.
